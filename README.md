WICKED AI 2.1.4
==============

Since I really like (read love) the Wicked AI missions and support for them has gone in the latest patches, I decided to dust off the old files and start making these 1.0.5+ compatible. Starting with a few minor bugfixes and some custom loadouts, but quickly turning into a proper redo with awesome help of the - very much alive - mod community!

### Release 2.1.0
- Bandit and hero missions
- Dynamic loot
- More missions
- Multi mission support
- Better markers
- [And much more](https://github.com/f3cuk/WICKED-AI/blob/master/changelist.md)

### Upcoming in 2.2.0+

- More missions
- Further enhancements
